# About ECOskiers

This repository was created in connection to the International Virtual Innovation Challenge at Hochschule München for the spring semester 2021. 

_,,Did you ever think about how sustainable your usual ski Resort is? Join us in Building the future of winter Sports by making environmentally friendly choices today! We make it easy for you to find a sustainable solution for your next ski trip."_

ECOskiers is an app making it easier for winter sport enthusiasts to make sustainable choices. As a skiier you do not have to get out of your comfortzone nor sacrifice convenience in order to act more environmentally friendly. Actually, you do not have to change your behavior significantly at all, other that choosing a better ski resort. This will also give the ski resorts incentives to improve their facilities and policies to take better care of nature. 
ECOskiers lets you have a quick and easy overview of different ski resorts and evaluates them based on different sustainablility factors such as: water usage, energy consumption and use of snow canons. These ratings come from a collaboration with the ski resorts, which answer questionnaires that give ECOskier information on their facilities and policies regarding environmental measures. This is henceforth evaluated by experts and implemented into the app.
The purpose of the app is not only to show which ski resorts are more sustainable, you can also book your ski resort directly through ECOskier. Besides the sustainability rating you can also see information such as live weather conditions, address, contact details and lenghts of the slopes. Another advantage for the user comes by booking the package deals, which are themselves all different, but can include accommodation, transportation and ski pass all in one. 

The concept is developed upon a great amount of research. The main problems for end users seemed to be the lack of knowledge on how to act more sustainable when skiing as well as the lack of willingness to sacrifice convenience. Therefore, the team was looking to make it easier for the young adult casual skier to make sustainable choices.
